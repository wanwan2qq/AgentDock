# ACP adapter for the Claude Agent SDK

[![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/%40agentclientprotocol%2Fclaude-agent-acp)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp)

Use [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview#branding-guidelines) from [ACP-compatible](https://agentclientprotocol.com) clients!

This tool implements an ACP agent by using the official [Claude Agent SDK](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/overview), supporting:

- Context @-mentions
- Images
- Tool calls (with permission requests)
- Following
- Edit review
- TODO lists
- Nested subagent transcripts
- Interactive (and background) terminals
- Custom [Slash commands](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands)
- Client MCP servers
- Session-scoped long-running goals through the provider-neutral [goal extension](docs/goal-extension.md)

Learn more about the [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com/).

### Nested subagent transcripts

ACP 1.2 has no standard subagent tool kind or nested-message relationship. Clients that can render
nested transcripts can opt in with `clientCapabilities._meta["subagent-transcript"] = true`.
The agent then forwards subagent text, thinking, and tool calls, relating nested updates to the
launching Agent/Task call through `_meta.claudeCode.parentToolUseId`. Agent/Task calls are marked
with `_meta.claudeCode.subagent = true`.

Clients that do not advertise the capability retain the legacy flattened behavior. In both modes,
the normal Agent/Task tool result is preserved as the protocol-compatible fallback.
