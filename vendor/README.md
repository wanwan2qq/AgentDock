# Vendored Dependencies

This directory is committed on purpose.

NeverWrite currently vendors upstream runtime projects that are needed for desktop
integration and release packaging, especially:

- `codex-acp`
- `Claude-agent-acp-upstream`
- `acp12`

Why this lives in git:

- release builds depend on these runtimes being available locally
- the desktop packaging flow stages binaries and runtime assets from here
- keeping the sources in-repo makes release inputs explicit and reproducible

What is currently required by the app/build pipeline:

- `codex-acp/`
  - used as a Rust crate and sidecar build input during desktop release builds
- `Claude-agent-acp-upstream/package.json`
  - used by the desktop build to validate and stage the embedded Claude runtime
- `Claude-agent-acp-upstream/dist/`
  - compiled runtime files that are copied into the desktop bundle
- `Claude-agent-acp-upstream/node_modules/`
  - production dependencies are installed by the Electron sidecar staging step
    and copied into the packaged embedded Claude runtime
- `acp12/`
  - used as Rust compatibility crates by the native backend for Grok legacy ACP
    sessions

What is vendored mainly for auditability and maintenance, not direct runtime use:

- `Claude-agent-acp-upstream/src/`
- `Claude-agent-acp-upstream/src/tests/`
- `Claude-agent-acp-upstream/dist/tests/`
- `Claude-agent-acp-upstream/docs/`
- `acp12/agent-client-protocol*/`
- assorted upstream config files (`tsconfig`, `vitest`, `eslint`, lockfiles)

That means the directory is intentionally reproducible, but not yet minimal.

## Current Baselines

- `codex-acp/`
  - upstream baseline: `zed-industries/codex-acp` `0.16.0`
  - synced against upstream commit `863d433fc91855d0b5427372bf635c894bf68cb6`
  - latest upstream sync from `0.14.0` brought in 5 commits:
    `d9bf1c1`, `0c2d828`, `8aef91b`, `f67ca5f`, `863d433`
  - OpenAI Codex Rust crates: `rust-v0.144.6`
    (`5d1fbf26c43abc65a203928b2e31561cb039e06d`)
  - vendor ACP SDK: `agent-client-protocol` `0.14.0`
  - includes a local `vendor/codex-utils-pty/` snapshot at `0.144.6` plus the
    matching `[patch."https://github.com/openai/codex"]` entry required by the
    OpenAI Codex crate graph
  - local NeverWrite delta remains intentionally bounded and currently lives in:
    - `vendor/codex-acp/Cargo.toml`
    - `vendor/codex-acp/Cargo.lock`
    - `vendor/codex-acp/src/lib.rs`
    - `vendor/codex-acp/src/codex_agent.rs`
    - `vendor/codex-acp/src/prompt_args.rs`
    - `vendor/codex-acp/src/subagents.rs`
    - `vendor/codex-acp/src/thread.rs`
    - `vendor/codex-acp/vendor/codex-utils-pty/`
- `Claude-agent-acp-upstream/`
  - vendored snapshot is currently based on `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp` `0.66.0`
  - upstream tag: `v0.66.0`
  - upstream commit: `6b405138fc82be947964612fac04e56654827b66`
  - dependencies match the upstream `0.66.0` release (`@agentclientprotocol/sdk` `1.3.0`, `@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk` `0.3.220`)
  - `dist/` is generated from the upstream source snapshot because the desktop packaging flow depends on it even though upstream does not track it in git
  - selective pin: stop at `0.66.0` (model-switch stall, tool heartbeats, Bash metadata). Do not take Vertex onboarding or the later `0.77+` protocol breaks.
- `acp12/`
  - local package names: `agent-client-protocol-legacy` and
    `agent-client-protocol-schema-legacy`
  - used by the native backend for Grok legacy ACP compatibility
  - kept separate from the current ACP path so Claude, Codex, Kilo, and OpenCode
    can continue to use the current protocol integration

## Current Codex Delta

The Codex vendor is no longer a raw upstream checkout. Its runtime compatibility
baseline is OpenAI Codex `rust-v0.144.6`, resolved to
`5d1fbf26c43abc65a203928b2e31561cb039e06d` in `Cargo.lock`.

The remaining NeverWrite-specific delta exists to preserve desktop product behavior:

- canonical `neverwrite*` and `codexAcp*` ACP metadata for status, turn lifecycle,
  plan updates, diffs, `user_input_request`, and child-session relationships
- reconstruction of `unified_diff` into `old_text`, `new_text` and hunk metadata for inline review and edited-files flows
- review-mode and review-finding adaptation while preserving inline review and
  accept/reject flows
- permission, mode, and approval-preset stability when Codex expands writable
  roots under `workspace-write`
- custom slash-prompt discovery and expansion without moving NeverWrite's prompt queue
- model discovery through the 0.144 HTTP client policy, Fast service-tier controls,
  and refreshed `ConfigOptionUpdate` values after successful model selection
- session-config synchronization from Codex `SessionConfiguredEvent` and thread
  snapshots, preserving model, provider, reasoning effort, service tier, and reviewer
- 0.144 compatibility for authentication/keyring selection, async login, reload,
  logout, and API-key flows without changing NeverWrite's credential policy
- MCP transport compatibility, including 0.144 auth fields and legacy app-path
  conversion, while retaining client-provided environment and approval settings
- explicit `PathUri` boundaries: UI paths use runtime rendering helpers and
  operational paths convert back to host-native paths
- state DB lookup plus thread-store and installation-ID wiring used by list,
  load, resume, fork, and child-thread registration
- actor lifecycle behavior that does not keep the internal message channel alive after external senders disappear
- subagent sessions with typed `ThreadId` identity, descriptive `agent_path` metadata,
  idempotent registration, and reconciliation after missed child-thread broadcasts
- a private `codexAcp*` subagent contract for session creation, navigable activity
  breadcrumbs, child lifecycle, and receiver-owned inter-agent transcripts
- per-turn coalescing of equivalent subagent waits; only fully terminal status sets
  complete the ACP activity
- a local `codex-utils-pty` 0.144.6 snapshot with process-group signaling and
  Windows input/ConPTY compatibility tests

The 0.144 API shapes for deferred turn items are handled as localized
projections. `SubAgentActivity` is projected through the same canonical
activity identity as its `TurnItem` fallback: matching protocol IDs update one
ACP tool call, while distinct IDs remain separate rather than being correlated
by descriptive metadata. Child `ThreadId` values remain authoritative; paths,
nicknames, and roles are display metadata only.

The remaining deferred work is:

- `ItemStarted`/`ItemCompleted` activity projection for new `TurnItem` variants in PR 3
- native image generation outside this PR series

The desktop release pipeline packages `codex-acp` and its `codex-code-mode-host`
companion for macOS universal, Windows x64/ARM64, and Linux x64/ARM64. Each
release build is lockfile-pinned. Its packaged smoke now drives an ACP
`initialize`, `session/new`, and `session/prompt` exchange through the packaged
code-mode host, with a deterministic local Responses mock; it verifies both the
tool completion and the assistant response.

When updating Codex again, treat upstream ACP commit
`863d433fc91855d0b5427372bf635c894bf68cb6`, OpenAI Codex tag
`rust-v0.144.6`, and the local PTY `0.144.6` snapshot as the comparison base.
Review the bounded delta file by file instead of replacing the vendor tree.

Canonical compatibility checks:

```bash
cargo check --locked --manifest-path vendor/codex-acp/Cargo.toml
cargo test --locked --manifest-path vendor/codex-acp/Cargo.toml
```

## Codex 0.144.6 Compatibility Baseline

The embedded runtime is pinned to OpenAI Codex `rust-v0.144.6`. Every Codex git
dependency in `codex-acp/Cargo.toml` uses that tag, and `Cargo.lock` resolves it
to `5d1fbf26c43abc65a203928b2e31561cb039e06d`. The local
`codex-utils-pty` snapshot is also `0.144.6`; it is part of the same runtime
baseline, not an independently updatable crate.

The vendor toolchain inherits Rust `1.96.0` from the repository-root
`rust-toolchain.toml`. This promotion deliberately does not change these
protocol boundaries:

- the `codex-acp` adapter package remains `0.16.0`
- the vendored ACP Rust SDK remains `agent-client-protocol` `0.14.0`
- the desktop native backend remains `agent-client-protocol` `1.2.0`, which it
  communicates through the serialized ACP protocol rather than a shared Rust
  crate boundary

### Product behavior covered by this baseline

- Code mode retains the 0.144 host/fallback compatibility path. The standalone
  `codex-code-mode-host` is packaged with the ACP sidecar, and the smoke forces
  that exact packaged host so an in-process fallback cannot hide a missing host.
- A definitive dangerous-command policy rejection is projected as a failed,
  terminal ACP tool activity with its visible reason; it never becomes an ACP
  permission request.
- Thread metadata now synchronizes both a selected reasoning effort and an
  explicit clearing of it, preventing a stale value after load, resume, or fork.
- Model context-window metadata remains dynamic. Regression coverage exercises
  the 272K context window reported for Sol, Terra, and Luna without hard-coding
  that size into the runtime.
- The public Full Access label and its ACP description remain unchanged. The UI
  adds only contextual help explaining that Codex safety policy can still block
  some destructive command forms.

### Packaged code-mode smoke matrix

| Package target | Executes the functional ACP code-mode smoke | Coverage when it cannot execute |
| --- | --- | --- |
| macOS universal | Yes, on a native runner slice | Both packaged host slices are staged |
| Windows x64 and ARM64 | Yes | — |
| Linux x64 | Yes | — |
| Linux ARM64 | No, because it is cross-compiled | Packaging, sidecar staging, and architecture checks run without executing the foreign binary |

The smoke uses a temporary `CODEX_HOME`, a local deterministic Responses mock,
and an explicit `CODEX_CODE_MODE_HOST_PATH`. It asserts a real ACP turn reaches
both a code-mode tool completion and a final assistant response; it does not
require credentials or a network service.

### Follow-up and rollback

The App Server adapter `1.1.4` is an architectural follow-up, not a replacement
made by this baseline. It must demonstrate parity for sessions, configuration
and permissions, review, inline changes, and accept/reject flows before it can
replace the current adapter.

#### Historical rollback baseline

To roll this runtime back, return `vendor/codex-acp/Cargo.toml`,
`vendor/codex-acp/Cargo.lock`, and `vendor/codex-acp/vendor/codex-utils-pty/`
together to OpenAI Codex `rust-v0.144.0`
(`767822446c7a594caa19609ca435281a9ec67e0d`) and its matching PTY snapshot.
Never roll back a single Codex crate or the PTY snapshot independently.

The desktop backend now supports a mixed ACP world: current ACP integration for
Claude, Codex, Kilo, and OpenCode, plus the vendored
`agent-client-protocol-legacy` crates for Grok. The native backend tests cover
the reconstructed diff, permission, status metadata, and legacy runtime
compatibility paths that NeverWrite depends on.

## Current Claude Delta

The Claude vendor is based on upstream `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp`
`0.59.0` with no expected NeverWrite-specific source delta.

The `dist/` directory is rebuilt from the vendored source snapshot because the
desktop packaging flow stages the compiled runtime files, while upstream does
not track generated output in git.

Electron release packaging treats the staged Claude runtime as incomplete unless
the packaged resources include:

- `native-backend/embedded/claude-agent-acp/dist/index.js`
- `native-backend/embedded/claude-agent-acp/node_modules/@agentclientprotocol/sdk/package.json`
- `native-backend/embedded/claude-agent-acp/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk/package.json`
- `native-backend/embedded/claude-agent-acp/node_modules/zod/package.json`

The only expected local non-source delta is the vendor `.gitignore`: NeverWrite
keeps `dist/` visible to Git so newly emitted runtime files are not missed.

NeverWrite advertises ACP client capabilities through the native backend, not by
patching the vendored Claude runtime. The active capability matrix for the
Claude runtime compatibility work is:

- `fs`: advertised
- `elicitation.form`: advertised; the native backend bridges form requests into
  NeverWrite's user-input UI
- `elicitation.url`: advertised; the native backend bridges URL requests into a
  compact timeline confirmation UI

## Updating Vendored Runtimes

When updating a vendored dependency:

1. Refresh the upstream snapshot to the exact release or commit you intend to ship.
2. Keep `dist/` aligned with the vendored Claude source snapshot.
3. Re-apply only the bounded local product delta that NeverWrite still needs.
4. Remove any local byproducts before committing.
5. Re-run the relevant validation:
   - `cargo test --locked --manifest-path vendor/codex-acp/Cargo.toml -q`
   - `cargo test -p neverwrite-native-backend`
   - `cd apps/desktop && npm test -- src/features/ai/store/chatStore.test.ts src/features/ai/components/AIReviewView.test.tsx src/features/ai/components/EditedFilesBufferPanel.test.tsx src/features/ai/components/reviewMultiSessionIntegration.test.tsx src/features/ai/components/AIChatMessageList.test.tsx src/features/ai/components/AIChatMessageItem.test.tsx src/features/editor/mergeViewSync.test.ts src/features/editor/extensions/mergeViewDiff.test.ts`

The repository keeps the Claude runtime snapshot broader than the minimum
runtime surface on purpose. The desktop build depends directly on `dist/`, while
the vendored source and test trees stay in-repo for auditability, upstream diff
review, and easier runtime updates.

What should not be committed here:

- local build outputs such as `target/`
- temporary install trees such as `node_modules/`
- transient bundler caches such as `.vite/`

Those generated paths are ignored in the repository root `.gitignore`.
