# AI Session History And Crash Recovery

AgentDock stores AI chat history locally. Each vault has one backend-owned
canonical scope: `device` or `vault`. The renderer asks the backend for that
scope; it never chooses a history root.

New vaults use device-local storage. Existing vaults that already contain
`.neverwrite/sessions` history are adopted as vault storage. In Settings, enable
**Store AI chats inside this vault** to move all history and pasted
`pasted-image-*` attachments into the vault. Moving back to device storage uses
the same copy-then-verify-then-delete flow.

## Disk Layout

Device-local sessions are stored under:

```text
<app-data>/ai-history/v1/vaults/<sha256(canonical-vault-path)>/.neverwrite/sessions/session-<sha256(session_id)>/
```

Vault-scoped sessions stay under:

```text
<vault>/.neverwrite/sessions/session-<sha256(session_id)>/
```

Each modern session directory contains:

- `session-meta.json`: session metadata such as runtime, model, mode, title, timestamps, parent session, and message count.
- `index.json`: transcript offsets, lengths, and message hashes used for windowed transcript loading.
- `transcript.jsonl`: newline-delimited JSON transcript entries.

Pasted chat screenshots follow the active scope:

```text
<app-data>/ai-history/v1/vaults/<vault-key>/assets/chat/pasted-image-*
# or, when vault storage is active:
<vault>/assets/chat/pasted-image-*
```

The `.neverwrite` directory is AgentDock's internal hidden-state directory.
Vault-scoped chat recovery uses `.neverwrite/sessions/`; device-scoped chat
recovery uses the app-data namespace shown above.

## Sessions, Sidebar Entries, And Workspace Views

For ACP chats, the Agents sidebar owns the durable live-session entry. Editor
tabs and panes are views into that session, so closing a chat tab does not stop
or delete the agent. The session remains available in the sidebar and can be
reopened in the focused chat tab, explicitly opened in a new tab, or placed in
another pane.

With history-based tab opening enabled, a physical chat tab can hold a local
Back/Forward history of sessions visited through that view. This workspace
navigation history is persisted with the editor session, but it is distinct
from the transcript stored under `.neverwrite/sessions/`.

Deleting a conversation is different from closing a view. Explicit deletion
removes physical tabs that display the session and prunes it from other chat-tab
histories. Sidebar pins and folder assignments are local UI metadata rather
than provider transcript data; they follow session ID migrations so a restored
or newly durable session keeps its organization.

Claude Code launched in an integrated terminal is not an ACP chat and does not
use this durable sidebar ownership model. Its sidebar row is a non-persisted
projection of the live terminal. Selecting the row focuses that terminal;
closing the terminal ends the process and removes the row. It has no chat-tab
Back/Forward history, saved chat view, or `Open in New Tab` action. Terminal tabs
can be restored as workspace tabs, but their current metadata does not relaunch
Claude Code or recreate the agent-sidebar projection after an app restart.

## Recovery Flow

After a crash, freeze, renderer reload, or AI runtime disconnect:

1. Reopen the same vault.
2. Open `Chat History`.
3. Select the saved conversation.
4. Click `Restore`.
5. Wait for `Reconnecting saved chat...` if the runtime needs to reconnect.
6. Send the next message normally.

When a provider supports native session loading, NeverWrite reconnects the
runtime session directly. When native loading is unavailable or unsafe,
NeverWrite creates a fresh runtime session and sends the saved transcript as
context with the next prompt.

If the app detects that an AI runtime lost its live connection, the chat can show:

```text
The AI runtime lost its connection. Reconnecting with saved context...
```

If reconnecting fails, the chat shows:

```text
Could not reconnect this chat. Start a new session with saved transcript context?
```

In that case, restore or fork the saved conversation from `Chat History`, then
send a new message so NeverWrite can continue with the stored transcript.

## Retention And Privacy Notes

- Session history follows the chat history retention setting in `Chat History`.
- Device-local history lives only in this app-data installation. Vault history
  is copied when the vault itself is synchronized or backed up.
- `transcript.jsonl` is stored as local plaintext JSONL while retained.
- Deleting a conversation from `Chat History` deletes its saved history from
  the active scope.
- If a recovered chat is missing, confirm you reopened the same vault, that the
  storage setting still points at the same scope, and that the retention window
  did not prune the conversation.
