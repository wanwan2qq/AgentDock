# Electron Release Feeds

This directory documents the Electron release topology for NeverWrite.

Electron now owns the signed desktop release path:

- manual installers live in `GitHub Releases`
- updater metadata lives in `gh-pages`
- updater downloads still resolve to `GitHub Releases`

## Published layout

GitHub Pages publishes one feed per channel, platform, and architecture:

```text
<channel>/<feed-target>/latest-mac.yml
<channel>/<feed-target>/latest.yml
<channel>/<feed-target>/latest-linux.yml
```

Current required feed targets (AgentDock fork ships Apple Silicon only):

| Build target | Feed target | Metadata file |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `aarch64-apple-darwin` | `darwin-universal` | `latest-mac.yml` |

The `darwin-universal` feed path is kept so already-installed clients continue to resolve updates. Windows/Linux targets remain supported by the libraries but are not part of the Release Desktop matrix.

Example published URL:

```text
https://wanwan2qq.github.io/AgentDock/stable/darwin-universal/latest-mac.yml
```

The updater metadata always points back to versioned assets on `GitHub Releases`.

## Release assets

Each build target uploads:

- one manual installer for humans
- optional additional manual installers, such as Linux `.deb` packages
- one updater asset for `electron-updater`
- one blockmap for differential updates

Public naming for the required Apple Silicon target:

| Build target | Manual asset | Additional manual asset | Updater asset |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `aarch64-apple-darwin` | `AgentDock_<version>_macOS_ARM64.dmg` | _None_ | `AgentDock_<version>_macOS_ARM64.zip` |

macOS Apple Silicon builds publish under the existing `darwin-universal` updater feed path for client compatibility.

For Ubuntu/Debian, the recommended installer is the `.deb` package:

```bash
sudo apt install ./NeverWrite-<version>-amd64.deb
```

Users who want future system updates should configure the signed NeverWrite APT
repository instead:

```bash
sudo install -d -m 0755 /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://jsgrrchg.github.io/NeverWrite/apt/neverwrite-archive-keyring.asc \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/neverwrite.asc >/dev/null
sudo chmod 0644 /etc/apt/keyrings/neverwrite.asc
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neverwrite.sources >/dev/null <<'EOF'
Types: deb
URIs: https://jsgrrchg.github.io/NeverWrite/apt
Suites: stable
Components: main
Architectures: amd64 arm64
Signed-By: /etc/apt/keyrings/neverwrite.asc
EOF
sudo apt update
sudo apt install neverwrite
```

The AppImage remains the portable Linux option and the only Linux package family
wired to the in-app updater. Debian packages update through `apt` when the APT
repository is configured.

## Signing and notarization

### macOS

The release workflow supports either notarization mode accepted by `electron-builder`:

1. App Store Connect API key
   - `APPLE_API_KEY`
   - `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`
   - `APPLE_API_ISSUER`
2. Apple ID + app-specific password
   - `APPLE_ID`
   - `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`
   - `APPLE_TEAM_ID`

macOS code signing also requires:

- `CSC_LINK`
- `CSC_KEY_PASSWORD`

### Windows

Windows releases are distributed unsigned for now. The release workflow disables
certificate auto-discovery for Windows builds and does not require `WIN_CSC_*`,
Azure Trusted Signing, or other Windows signing secrets.

Unsigned Windows installers can trigger SmartScreen or Defender warnings until a
future signed distribution path builds reputation.

## Workflow

The production release entrypoint is:

- `.github/workflows/release-desktop.yml`

High-level flow:

1. validate version identity and changelog
2. build one target per matrix entry
3. smoke the packaged native sidecar
4. stage release assets and target metadata as internal workflow artifacts
5. publish all release files to `GitHub Releases` after every target succeeds
6. publish feeds and the signed APT repository to `gh-pages`
7. generate a platform validation pack

## Version readiness

The release tag is the source of truth for GitHub Actions, but the tag must
match the desktop metadata committed at that tag. Before pushing `vX.Y.Z`, make
sure these files all refer to `X.Y.Z`:

- `apps/desktop/package.json`
- `apps/desktop/package-lock.json`
- `apps/desktop/native-backend/Cargo.toml`
- `apps/web-clipper/package.json`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

Use the helper from the repository root to update the package, native backend,
and Web Clipper version files:

```bash
scripts/bump-version.sh X.Y.Z
```

Then add the matching `CHANGELOG.md` release entry and run the same validation
that the release workflow runs:

```bash
node scripts/validate-release-metadata.mjs --tag vX.Y.Z
```

Do not push the tag until this check passes. The app's user-visible Electron
version comes from `apps/desktop/package.json`; the lockfile and native backend
version are kept aligned with the Web Clipper manifest version so packaging and
release validation remain deterministic.

## Local build commands

From `apps/desktop`:

```bash
npm run electron:build
npm run electron:package:unsigned
npm run electron:dist:mac
npm run electron:dist:win -- --arch x64
npm run electron:dist:win -- --arch arm64
```

The release wrapper is target-aware and stages the correct Rust sidecar for the selected architecture before calling `electron-builder`. For universal macOS builds, CI downloads both Node runtimes and stages a lipo'd embedded Node binary via `NEVERWRITE_EMBEDDED_NODE_BIN_ARM64` and `NEVERWRITE_EMBEDDED_NODE_BIN_X64`.

## Local updater validation

The runtime updater is intentionally strict:

- packaged builds only allow production `https` feeds by default
- non-packaged builds only allow loopback or `file:` feeds by default
- feed hosts and download hosts can be allowlisted explicitly
- production downloads default to `github.com`

Runtime knobs:

- Packaged builds default to `https://jsgrrchg.github.io/NeverWrite`.
- The env vars below are overrides for local validation, staging feeds, or one-off diagnostics.
- `NEVERWRITE_UPDATER_BASE_URL`
- `NEVERWRITE_UPDATER_ENDPOINT`
- `NEVERWRITE_UPDATER_CHANNEL`
- `NEVERWRITE_UPDATER_ALLOWED_FEED_HOSTS`
- `NEVERWRITE_UPDATER_ALLOWED_DOWNLOAD_HOSTS`
- `NEVERWRITE_UPDATER_ALLOW_PRODUCTION_ENDPOINTS_IN_NON_PROD`

Validation pack generation:

```bash
node scripts/build-platform-validation-pack.mjs \
  --version 0.2.0 \
  --tag v0.2.0 \
  --channel stable \
  --feeds-dir .artifacts/feeds \
  --metadata-dir .artifacts/release-targets \
  --output-dir dist/platform-validation/v0.2.0
```

The validation pack includes:

- target-specific valid feeds
- target-specific invalid-checksum fixtures
- a checklist for clean install, update, target routing, and sensitive-state confirmation

## Browser extension release assets

The desktop release workflow also builds the Web Clipper from `apps/web-clipper`
and attaches browser-extension zips to the GitHub Release:

- `NeverWrite-Web-Clipper-vX.Y.Z-chrome-mv3.zip`
- `NeverWrite-Web-Clipper-vX.Y.Z-firefox-mv3.zip`

The Chrome zip is for manual unpacked installation. The Firefox zip is a build
artifact for testing, traceability, and Mozilla signing workflows.

## Rollback

Rollback means publishing feed metadata that no longer points to the defective version.

Because the updater reads target-specific feeds, rollback can be:

- global for every target in a channel, or
- scoped to one target if only one architecture is affected

Do not delete release assets as the first reaction. First stop advertising the bad version from the published feed for the affected targets.
